But folks hav v really achieved Independence</p>', '<p>Yet another Independence Day comes by, this being the 66th anniversary celebrating the culmination of a long and arduous journey for liberation from foreign rule and the beginning of yet another of nation building. But folks hav v really achieved Independence and what does that word mean in the present context where a significant amount of our citizen live in poverty. A country which still has farmer suicides and malnutrition deaths. Who is responsible for our condition??<br /><br />Everywhere money is King. Not the voter, not the constitution, but money. When something or someone is king, what becomes of the republic? From the roadside vendor who has to pay a regular mamul to the giant Corporate that bribes it''s way to contracts, we are now become a Jamhuriyat-I-Naqad, a Republic of Cash.&nbsp;<br /><br />What would Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru would have said today if he was PM. Would he still have used his famous Hindustani words such as sifat(quality), iman(probity), zamir(conscience), words which may seem a bit archaic today. Archaic, I say with confidence on a day where the Parliament is obsessed by its honour when it should be absorbed by its duties, political spectrum mired with scams of such large proportions that small corruption seems trivial.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have become soulless people, a people without self-confidence, without morale. A nation that do not have ideals cannot survive.<br />We now live in a challenging economic and security climate. Growth is down, inflation is up. Forex reserves are depleting and economy stagflating.&nbsp;<br />Our neighbours present a formidable security issue for we are surrounded by problems-<br />Pakistan- a failed state always a threat&nbsp;<br />Afghanistan- with the US troops retreating and Taliban taking over<br />Sri Lanka- Constant war b/w Tamils and Singhalese.&nbsp;<br />Nepal - with no government or constitution for over an year and Maoists in power who are pro china.&nbsp;<br />China- incursions into India and conquest of the South China Sea.&nbsp;<br />Bangladesh- with Jamaat-e- Islami and Shahbag protests threatening its stability<br />Myanmar- where Rohingya Muslims and Rakhine Buddhists fight it out for identity&nbsp;<br /><br />How good is our internal security, where the PM had to state that Maoism is Indias biggest threat in the 21st century, ironically on Independence Day from the Red Fort.&nbsp;<br />Red Fort which has seen great transactions of time, such as the stately durbars of Shah Jahan, the petty machinations of Aurengzeb, the trial and murder of Dara Shikoh, the plunder by Nadir Shah and his loot of Peacock Throne, the carnage of Great War of Independence, Bahadur Shah Zafars great sacrifice and the trial of brave INA soldiers and of the small men who killed our Mahatma, is now just a spectacle, silent stones listening to political blabber and false promises.&nbsp;<br /><br />So is there no hope?? Is it all finished?? Most certainly not. India and Indians hav almost always triumphed in times of adversities. When Winston Churchill equated India to the Equator, many agreed with him. But we have proved them wrong. We have stood steady as a nation for the past 66 years and will continue to stand. We have risen from almost nothing to the third largest economy in the world in PPP terms. We are the second largest growing economy among major countries. We have achieved heights that for many like Churchill seemed like the equator- non existent.&nbsp;<br />Our country needs to reinvent itself through the ideals and dreams that drove the Independence Movement and ponder over the question - have we achieved real Independence??<br /><br /></p>', '2013-08-15 08:28:35'),

A famous shrine Gorakhnath was built in his honour here.&nbsp;<br />Gorakhpur was part of the famous kingdom of Koshal, one of sixteen mahajanpadas in 6th century BC. It has its own historical and cultural significance being closely associated with the Great Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir and the famous saint Kabir who though was born in Varanasi, used to work in Maghar, Gorakhpur.&nbsp;<br />The historic CHAURI CHAURA incident of 4th Feb 1922 which was a turning point in India''s freedom struggle took place here. Enraged at the inhuman barbaric atrocities of the police the volunteers burnt down the Chauri-Chaura Police station, prompting Gandhiji to withdraw the Non- Cooperation movement launched in 1920.&nbsp;<br /><br />Bordering Nepal in the north-eastern part of UP, Gorakhpur today is one of the most backward districts of India.<br />This region is endemic to Japanese Encephalitis and every year multiple deaths are reported.&nbsp;<br />The world woke last Saturday to the news that numerous infants had died in BRD Medical College due to lack of oxygen supply. Apparently oxygen supply to the hospital was cutoff over non-payment of dues. The death count as of the day this is being written is 73 and counting.&nbsp;<br /><br />BRD Medical college is the biggest tertiary centre in that region which attracts patients even from neighbouring Bihar and Nepal. According to reports the load on doctors here is higher than any other government hospital in India.&nbsp;<br /><br />The way the Yogi Adityanath Government at the state and Modi government at the centre handled their emergency situation was horrifying.&nbsp;<br />First the CM delayed in responding to the issue. Then when he ultimately came forward, he was in denial putting the reason for these death as Japanese Encephalitis. Such insensitively on the part of the Government is unacceptable.&nbsp;<br /><br />Central Health Minister visited the hospital a day too late. Death counts are going on increasing and the state administration seems to be in no mood to act responsibly.&nbsp;<br />Playing politics at time of adversity is the last thing needed here.&nbsp;<br />Our Prime Minister who otherwise takes to Twitter for every other event from forest fires in Portugal to military jet crash in Russia has kept silence on this matter. I guess the death of 73 infants in his own country is not matter enough to get response from our PM. As they say human lives won''t fetch votes.&nbsp;<br />Not surprising from a PM who''s ideology and politics puts the life of a cow as more important to that of humans.&nbsp;<br /><br />The scenes from the hospital were heart wrenching to say the least. Infant dead bodies being carried by their grieving parents due to lack of ambulances. A doctor who paid from his own purse to provide Oxygen cylinder being suspended. Grieving parents being advised by authorities not to speak to the media.&nbsp;<br />To add insult to injury the response of the ruling party president comes in. To quote ''congress ka kaam he isteefa mangna. Itne bade desh mein bahuth sare haadse hue, pahle bar aisa haadsa nahi hua he''. What sort of comment is this. Highly irresponsible and irreverent towards all those children who succumbed to negligence. It is we who are to blame- after all the people gets the government that it deserves.&nbsp;<br /><br />The need of the hour is not mudslinging and politics. The need is urgent action on the part of administration. Immediate medical help provided to the patients. More doctors to be provided to BRD Medical college to meet the needs. Funds allocated to provide whatever needed so that no more lives are lost to negligence. And lastly, to hold whomsoever responsible for the tragedy.&nbsp;<br />In the long term what is needed is a comprehensive overhaul of the Medical system in India. If our PM wants to create a new India by 2022 as he promises, he should start with healthcare.&nbsp;<br />Providing good healthcare facilities is the first step towards a modern India. Let us hope that such tragedies never occur again, the lesson is learnt and the Governments gets up from its slumber to act before apocalypse.&nbsp;<br />Food for thought........&nbsp;</p>', '2017-08-14 23:20:24'),

', 'amish_village_1542270926.jpg', '<p>I recently had the opportunity to visit the United States and the most striking among my travels was the visit to the <strong>Amish Village.</strong>&nbsp;</p>', '<div>I recently had the opportunity to visit the United States and the most striking among my travels was the visit to the Amish Village.&nbsp;<br />Located in Pennsylvania state, the Amish village was something totally unexpected and created ample amusement and interest among us. It was nothing that we expected to find in the United States, the idea of which one gets through media and books as a post-modern concrete jungle.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Amish are a group of people who migrated to the states in the late 17th century from Germany and Switzerland fearing religious persecution.&nbsp;<br />The history of Amish church began with a schism in Switzerland within a group of Swiss and Alsatian Anabaptists in late 1600s led by Jacob Ammann. Those who followed Ammann became known as Amish. In the late 19th century, the Amish themselves got divided into the Old order Amish and the Amish Mennonites. The Mennonites integrated into the society and the old order retained its culture.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the early 18th century many Amish migrated to Pennsylvania for a variety of reasons. Pennsylvania was then known for religious toleration. The migration was basically a reaction to poverty, religious wars and persecution in Europe. Many settled in Lancaster county where I found myself as an enthusiastic tourist on a hot, humid typical American afternoon.&nbsp;<br /><br />The fact that my cousins lived in Pennsylvania and their ready enthusiasm to drive us to the Village helped. The roads got narrower and the streets less inhabited as we moved from the thickly populated Pennsylvania suburbs to the Amish Village. The first thing I noticed were vast Corn fields extending far beyond the horizon. The countryside would take anyone''s breath away with its serene beauty.&nbsp;<br />Houses were few and far between. I was corrected by my cousin and guide that those were not houses, but small factories processing corn and milk. Amish were good at building apparently and many readymade houses were on display on both sides of the road. You could walk up to a house, pay for it, tow it to your car and drive away your house on wheels to wherever you want.&nbsp;<br />To watch Amish on their horse driven buggies in their traditional attire was a feast to the eyes. The men had full grown moustaches and beards, while the beautiful womenfolk looked as if from a classic gangster movie.&nbsp;<br /><br />On the way to our final destination we stopped at an Amish farm. What I saw there was a rare sight. I have never seen a more beautiful animal before. Golden coloured horses in their prime with supple bodies and graceful charm. There were other livestock too with milk being the main production in the particular farm. The farmowner, a typical Amish with his beard and hat greeted us with suspicion and politely told us to leave his private farm. He had a small shop in his farm where he was selling fresh milk, and few dairy products. For tourists, he adviced us thst this is not the place and that we should head along.&nbsp;<br /><br />We took the man''s advice and moved ahead. We didn''t have to go too far, as we reached the Amish Village tourist centre. It was like any other tourist destination, busy with eager tourists holding aloft their cameras and clicking away. The entrance to the Amish Village was a sloping roofed white cottage which held the souvenir shop. You could get all types of books and pamphlets on Amish history. Soaps, shampoo handmade by the Amish and other paraphernalia including bracelets, rings and the like. There was an interesting book on Amish home remedies for ailments from common cold to wading off evil spirits.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then began our tour of a typical Amish house. We were then escorted into a small hall inside the Amish house, by our guide Bill. Bill was Amish and had taken up job as a tour guide. He gave us a brief history on the Amish after which we were escorted into the Dining and Kitchen of the Amish. I found it bemusing that the Amish did not use electricity. They had a Mechanical refrigerator, pressurised lamps and motorised washing machines. The Amish seemed to allow the use of Natural gas. They seemed to built beautiful quilts seen on display in their modest bedrooms. The tour of the house ended with a display of rotor tiller , power lawn mower, propane gas, bulk milk tank, pickup balers, chain saw, and tractors for belt power.&nbsp;<br />Next we moved to the stables where another set of horses were on hold. There were rabbits, pigs, chickens, Pony, and turkeys in the small farm. Whatever said and done, the animals seemed well fed and looked after.&nbsp;<br />Now we proceeded to the exit and were greeted by another souvenir shop across a small pond which we crossed through a wooden bridge- Amish built. The scenery was beyond words.&nbsp;<br />The Amish spoke Pennsylvanian Dutch, which was not Dutch but a dialect of German.&nbsp;<br />The population in US seems to have increased over the years with Amish migrating to other areas including Canada and Latin America. Only few outsiders have joined Amish. Since 1950 only 75 people to be exact.&nbsp;<br />Amish people have higher incidences of specific medical conditions including Angelman syndrome, dwarfism and various metabolic disorders. The also have an unusual distribution of blood types. The Amish only marry within their community increasing the risk for genetic diseases, but continue to do so for religious reasons.&nbsp;<br /><br />Overall, it was a wonderful learning experience. To know such people still existed in the modern world, especially in the United States was new to us. The Amish are resilient people who have resisted modernisation even while enduring great hardships. They have made their livelihood from farms which Americans considered wasteland. They have innovated with umpteen inventions as I mentioned before and seem to be content with what they have. In the post-modern artificial world that we live in, the Amish story stands out as an aberration, a revolution of people who won''t be separated from their roots and religious beliefs. What other countries could learn is the way Americans have accepted different religions and ethnicity into their homeland and shared their resources with them. The Buddhists rulers of Myanmar and the Israelis can take a leaf out of the Americans as examples. In a similar way the Rohingyan Muslims and the Palestinians can learn a bit too from the Amish resilience.&nbsp;<br /><br />Food for thought.......</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2018-06-22 23:10:35'),

It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results". This quote I stumbled upon on twitter, made me think. How better the world will be if everyone thinks positive- we would have a socialist utopia.&nbsp;</p>', '<p>Talking of utopia, the international scene is as utopian since my last literary outing.&nbsp;<br />In Venenzuela, Nicolas Maduro comes to power for a second time in an election boycotted by most right-wing parties at the instance of United States. The country is going through a huge economic crisis with even today''s newspaper stating the price of coffee costing 1140 bolivar. In the month of June the inflation was 46,000 percent it seems!! All these events started in 2014 since the oil crisis and price drop. The newly reelected president, an ardent supporter of Hugo Chavez has his hands full. The newly launched cryptocurrency in the country, Petro shows promise. It is backed by the countries vast oil and mineral reserves. India has been offered a 30 percent discount if it deals in Petroleum, which can bring down the skyrocketing fuel prices in the country. It is yet to be seen if India will catch bait. Cryptocurrency will help Venenzuela to evade the draconian US sanctions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Coming from South America to a country which itself is confused whether it is in Asia or Europe- Turkey seems to be an amalgamation of the west and east. With a Muslim majority population, it seems to an aberration. Living in the legacy of the old Ottoman Empire the once famed Ataturk, is a shadow of its past. However it is undergoing a political transformation. The President Recap Tayyip Erdorgan is reelected for the second time but this time with executive powers. It was no long ago that turkey voted in a referendum to narrowly pass the resolution changing the constitution from a Parliamentary democracy to one where most of the power is concentrated at the hands of the President. There will no longer be a Prime Minister, and Parliament will take a supervisory role. The President will appoint Vice President and senior judges. All these since the attempted coup to oust Erdorgan, the then Prime Minister in 2016. The newly elected President has a long haul ahead, however he has problems too including Syria, and the Kurdish problem. Erdorgan was an avid supporter of the Arab Spring and did not foresee the fall of Egypt. Then came Syria. However he has maintained good relations with Saudi Arabia which is trying to subvert the last Republic government in the region - Syria.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is a year since Qatar was removed from the Gulf Cooperation Council and they still remain resilient. This would come as a bitter surprise to Saudi Arabia who do not want to recognise the failure of their plan at isolation and intimidation. The charges levied by Saudi, UAE and Baharain on Qatar including funding terrorism do not stand ground as all three countries have funded different terrorist groups. The demand for shutting down Al Jazeera which is an independent, professionally run agency is preposterous. The main reason for the blockade can be attributed to the growth of Qatar. From being a poor country when the GCC was constituted, Qatar has transformed itself into a powerhouse by selling natural gas to the US. It has had military and diplomatic relations with US with Americans maintaining a base in Qatar with 11,000 personnel. During the Arab Spring in 2011, the Saudi and Qatar supported different groups, Doha supporting the Muslim Brotherhood which the Saudis despised. Hence when Donald Trump took over the reigns, the Saudis went out of the way to befriend Trump to maintain its clout over the region. With Doha holding the 2022 FIFA World Cup, we can expect it to become a world centre stage giving it a boost economically. How the Saudis react to this is yet to be seen.&nbsp;<br /><br />Coming to our own Kerala, the early detection of Nipah virus and prompt action taken by the government, with complete support of the opposition and the civil society led to containainment of the deadly outbreak and restricted it to two Districts in Northern Malabar. WHO says the Nipah viral encephalitis is an emerging infectious disease spread by secretions of infected bats. It can spread to humans through contaminated fruits, infected animals or close contact with infected humans. The fruit bats of Pteropodidae family are the natural hosts of the virus. The virus infection in humans causes wide range of clinical presentation from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis, which is infection to the brain. The fatality rate is up to 75%. The virus is highly virulent and lethal and there are no medicines or vaccines. Hospitals can only give supportive intensive care mostly to treat respiratory and neurological complications. Nipah and its closely related Hendra virus is listed in as "Category C biothreat agents" because they can be isolated from their natural reservoir, easily grown to large amounts in a laboratory and transmitted through easy means. Its incubation period is between 4-18 days.&nbsp;<br />The identified risky behaviour of the index cases in Bangladesh is the consumption of raw date palm sap which could be contaminated by virus shed by bats through saliva and urine. The virus was first isolated from a patient from Sungai Nipah in Malaysia and is therefore named after the Village. The take away message is Early Detection of the disease, to be in the lookout for the disease in cases of PUO,( Pyrexia of Unknown Origin) which is the most commonly encountered scenario in an OPD setup. The way the Kerala medical fraternity handled the outbreak is commendable. We have all seen the heart-wrenching scene of death of the Nurse who took care of the first family contracted by this disease. Her letter at her deathbed to her young husband and infant kids should be reminder to further medical professionals. Her sacrifice should not go in vain and with proper governmental support future outbreaks can be contained and mortality restricted if not completely eliminated.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am consciously not writing on the present political situation in India. I have written many times on the issue and my views are clear. Much before Shashi Tharoor sir warned us Indian to vote responsibly in the next election or face the prospects of a "Hindu Pakistan" , I had through one of my Musings, mentioned of the possibility of the RSS filled government rewriting our constitution. Not taking anything away from the Thiruvananthapuram MP for his political acumen.&nbsp;<br />A fractured mandate in the next General Election could see us having a regional leader as our Next Prime Minister. However previous experiments with coalition governments formed with the only agenda to keep their enemy from power has failed miserably. Whether the highly anticipated Mahagadbandhan will take off and if at all it does who will lead such a combination of varied interests, and will it last it''s tenure will be something which only time will tell. One this is for sure, whichever government comes into power, if they take the interest of the country and the people as its prime agenda, then no one will be able to stop them.&nbsp;<br /><br />There has been a general trend in Kerala for a few years now wherein whoever takes a secular stand towards the Majority community to be branded as a Sanghi and the other way around where support to Minority community being considered as minority appeasement and anti- Hindu. This trend has started since the common public has taken to social media where there is no check to what amount of rubbish they can write. People who were very jovial and friendly to each other in person, neighbours for example, are turning against each other on social media leading to further deterioration of their friendly relation.<br />A general sense of hatred against each other is brewing for a few years now. This can be attributed to the highly divisive government that we have at the centre and the general mood of the public being right wing. Unless a secular counterforce is applied to our society things could take an ugly turn. If the situation in Kerala is such, I need not tell about other places of our country. The Indian National Congress which has a great past at creation of India and secular credentials should take over the responsibility of holding together society as a whole. Instead of relegating itself with soft Hindutva and rather than benign a B team to the right wing BJP, it should clear its ideology among the public. A crisp and clear ideology for the party rather than dilly dallying with confused rhetoric will help the party''s prospects in short and the country future in general.&nbsp;<br /><br />Food for Thought.......</p>', '2018-11-09 13:53:34'),

My idea for this article is the first one.<br /><br />Cherished moments are blessings that come by and one such moment was my recent trip to Chennai, Kanchipuram to be exact. Kanchipuram at a distance of 70 odd kilometres from Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu is a city that holds years of history.<br /><br />Kanchipuram or Kanchi is the headquarters of the Kanchi Mutt, monastic institution founded by the saint Adi Shankaracharya. This city has been ruled by Pallavas ( was the capital between 4th and 9th Century ), Medivial and Later Cholas, Later Pandyas, Vijayanagara Empire, the Carnatic Kingdom and the British who called the city Conjeevaram.<br /><br />Kanchipuram in Sanskrit means place from where Lord Brahma worshipped Lord Shiva. It is located in the banks of Vegavathi river, a tributary of the Palar River.<br /><br />Buddhism flourished in Kanchipuram between 1st and 5th century. According to folklore, Bodhidharma a 5th Century Buddhist monk and founder of Shaolin Kung Fu was the third son of a Pallava King from Kanchipuram. Buddhist institutions from Kanchipuram spread Theravada Buddhism to the people of Myanmar and Thailand who in return spread the religion to incoming Burmese and Thai people.<br /><br />Jainism was introduced to Kanchipuram by Kunda Kundacharya in 1st century and spread by Akalanka and Kalbhras, the rulers of Kanchi before the Pallavas. Trilokanatha/Chandraprabha temple is a twin Jain temple and has inscriptions from Pallava and Chola Kings.<br /><br />Hindus consider Kanchipuram to be one of the seven holiest cities in India, the Sapta Puri.<br />Sapta Puri temples----<br />1) Ayodhya ( Vishnu as Rama )<br />2) Mathura ( Vishnu as Krishna )<br />3) Haridwar ( Shiva as Gangadhar )<br />4) Varanasi ( Shiva as Vishwanath )<br />5) Kanchipuram ( Durga as Parvati )<br />6) Ujjain ( Shiva as Mahakaleshwar )<br />7) Dwarka ( Vishnu as Krishna )</p>\r\n<p>Kanchipuram has 108 Shaiva and 18 Vaishnava temples. Ramanujacharya, the Hindu philosopher who propagated Vishishtadvaita philosophy studied here. Kamakshi Amman temple is the most famous in the city. It is associated with Adi Shankara and ledgend has it that Kamakshi offered worship to a Shivaling made out of sand and gained Lord Shiva''s hand in marriage. Ekambareshwarar temple, dedicated to one of the five elements, the Pancha Bhootha Sthalas, and specifically the element of Earth or Prithvi.<br />Legend has it that Parvati was cursed to become dark like Kali. She did penance under the temple Mango tree. In order to test her devotion, Shiva set fire upon her. Hence, Lord Shiva here is called Ekambareshwar ( Lord of Mango tree ). Other legend says Prithvi Lingam made of sand was worshipped by Parvati or Kamakshi. River Vegavathi threatened to overflow the sand Shiva lingam. Parvati embraced the Shivalingam to protect it from harm and touched by the gesture, Shiva came in person to marry Parvati.<br /><br />Varadaraja Perumal temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu is the largest Vishnu temple in Kanchipuram. Built by the Cholas, it is one of the divyadeshams, the 108 holy abodes of Vishnu. Robert Clive is said to have presented an emerald necklace to the temple and is still used to decorate the deity, called the Clive Makarakandi.<br /><br />The city has two mosques one near Ekambareshwar temple built by the Navab of Arcot in the 17th Century and another near Vaikuntha Perumal Temple, with which it shares a common tank. Muslims take part in festival of Varadarajaswamy temple.<br />Christ church, is the oldest church in the city built by the British in Scottish style brick architecture with arches and pillars.<br /><br />Such examples of Religious tolerance and intermingling of society is something which was heartening to see. I still believe all communal hatred spread through fake news and propaganda building can be eliminated through community effort and partnership. Governments of our times can play a major role in developing mutual respect and sense of brotherhood among people belonging to different religions and within religions. &nbsp;It is imperative upon the Secular forces of our country &nbsp;to highlight such examples to counter the divisive Right wing forces in our country.<br /><br />Any travelogue on Kanchipuram would be incomplete without mentioning about the silk weaving and handloom industry producing Kanchipuram Sarees. Worth â‚¹100 crores the industry received the Geographical Indication tag in 2005, the first product to receive the label in our country.<br />The silk trade began during the times of Raja Raja Chola I who invited weavers to migrate to Kanchi. Mass migration happened from Andhra Pradesh during the Vijayanagara rule.</p>\r\n<p>According to Hindu mythology, Kanchi silk weavers are the descendants of the Sage Markanda, the master weaver of a Gods who is supposed to have woven tissue from lotus fibre. While cotton is considered the favourite fabric of Lord Shiva, silk is preferred by Lord Vishnu.<br />Kanchipuram sarees are depicted in paintings of a Raja Ravi Verma and epics of Mahabharata and Ramayana.<br /><br />As a traveller and an outsider I watched history flash before my eyes as I visited these places. Such rich culture and heritage of our country so near yet so far was something hard to digest. The realisation that Chola and Vijayanagara kings had walked the same sanctum sanctorum of the temple was mind blowing.<br /><br />To know such rich heritage and religious tolerance of olden times made me ponder over the futility of what is happening in our times. Whether it be Ayodhya issues or Sabarimala women entry issue, divisive forces trying to polarise our society is saddening. Our country has the history of accepting guests as our own. Vasudeva Kudumbakam has, is and will be our motto. Religious tolerance has been our theme and if few extremist outfits think they can rewrite history by changing names of cities and spreading fake news- they are thoroughly mistaken. &nbsp;As they say " The time for action is now. It''s never too late to do something".<br /><br />Food for Thought.......</p>', '2018-11-14 06:37:35');
